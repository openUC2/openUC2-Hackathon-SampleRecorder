# SampleRecorder - A Cassette-based continous sample collection and acuisition tool

Welcome to the openOCT Hackathon! In this hackathon, we will be addressing the crucial need for an open-source device that can continously collect all kinds of microscopic samples. For this we want to recycle old audio cassetes and add this to our microsocpes. A first prototype exists. It has to be extended by a UV curing assembly that first applies uv nailpolish before it gets cured by UV LEDs. Nailpolish is sticky enough to e.g. collect particles in the air but flexible enough to roll it up once dried.
The primary goal is to hook up the device on a bike and then capture airborne microparticles

More information will come soon! For now, please stick to the images and videos below :-)

The tape can be "played" in one directon only
